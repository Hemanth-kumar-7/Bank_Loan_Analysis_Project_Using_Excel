#  Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard | Excel 

##  Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard developed using Microsoft Excel.  
The objective is to evaluate the performance of a lending portfolio through key financial metrics, track trends over time, and generate insights that assist stakeholders in data-driven decision-making.

The dashboard leverages Excelâ€™s analytical and visualization capabilitiesâ€”Power Query, Pivot Tables, and dynamic KPIsâ€”to monitor lending efficiency, repayment behavior, and borrower health across different time periods.

## Project Objectives
The primary goal of this project was to build a fully interactive Excel dashboard that provides business users with real-time visibility into the bankâ€™s loan operations. The dashboard enables management to:

- Assess the volume and trend of loan applications received.  
- Evaluate the total funds disbursed and repayments collected.  
- Monitor interest rate variations and borrower debt ratios.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### 1. **Total Loan Applications**
Measures the number of loan applications submitted within a given period. Tracking this KPI helps monitor demand trends and growth rates across months.

### 2. **Total Funded Amount**
Represents the overall value of loans disbursed. It highlights the institutionâ€™s lending volume and assists in evaluating capital utilization efficiency.

### 3. **Total Amount Received**
Captures the total repayments made by borrowers. This KPI provides visibility into cash inflows and loan recovery performance.

### 4. **Average Interest Rate**
Calculates the mean interest rate across all approved loans. Monitoring this indicator over time reveals shifts in lending strategies and cost of credit.

### 5. **Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)**
Evaluates borrowersâ€™ financial health by comparing their debt obligations to income levels. A lower DTI reflects a more sustainable loan portfolio and reduced credit risk.

##  Business Insights
- Consistent growth in loan applications indicated increased customer confidence and strong market demand.  
- A healthy ratio between total funded amounts and repayments suggested efficient collection and repayment processes.  
- Fluctuations in average interest rates helped identify opportunities to optimize pricing and improve competitiveness.  
- A gradual decrease in average DTI signified improved borrower creditworthiness and lower default probability.

These insights can guide strategic decisions around credit policy, lending targets, and customer segmentation.
